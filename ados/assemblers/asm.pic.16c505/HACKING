PIC 16C505 has 72 dat bits (thus NAME in parser.y is an integer between 72/12=6 and 0 as the PIC has 12bit instruction width)

The code.ooo file contains the output machine code. Each 4 bits (2^8) of the 12bit wide instructions is encoded as a hex number in this file. Thus you can
use perl for further hacking it (run 'perldoc -q convert').

For more information look at the PIC datasheet e.g. operator (opcode) and operandi.
