This tpicasm manual exists in 2 parts : the mini-C language coupled to the 
PIC assembler and the assembly codes themselves:

1. mini-C operators
--------------------------

You can do the following in version 0.9.11 :

int a = 1223;

if (1) { 1 + 2 }
if-and(2) { 1 + 2 }

1 + 2
1 - 2
1 * 2
1 / 2

int a = 1223;
if (a) { a = a + a }

You can do the following in version 0.9.14 :

a || b && c && !d

You can do the following in version 0.9.19 :

char pc = 255;

You can do the following in version 0.9.25 :

There are blocks now ({ /* code */ })
There are C-style comments 
There is an else clause for if
There is a if-and (AND assembler if clause conditional)

2. PIC Assembly code manual (as of version 0.9.1)
------------------------------------------------

. W is the status register, f is file offset (5bits long) and d (3bits or sometimes 1 bit long.)

. Byte-Oriented file register operations: d = 0 for destination W d = 1 for desitination f, f = 5-bit register address.

 (Read the operandi (e.g. f,d) from left to right in the ASCII figures here below
  11------6-5-4-----0
  OPCODE--d---f------

 OPCODES AND OPERANDI:

 ADDWF f,d : Add W and f
 ANDWF f,d : And W with f
 CLRF f    : Clear f
 CLRW      : Clear W
 COMF f,d  : Complement f
 DECF f,d  : Decrement f
 DECFSZ f,d: Decrement f, Skip if 0
 INCF f,d  : Increment f
 INCFSZ f,d: Increment f, Skip if 0
 IORWF f,d : Inclusive OR W with f
 MOVF  f,d : Move f
 MOVWF f   : Move W to f
 NOP       : No operation
 RLF   f,d : Rotate left f through carry
 RRF   f,d : Rotate right through carry
 SUBWF f,d : Substract W from f
 SWAPF f,d : Swap f
 XORWF f,d : Exclusive OR with f
 
. Bit-Oriented file register operations: b = 3bits long, f file register 5bits long.
  11------8-7--5-4-----0
  OPCODE--b------f------

  OPCODES AND OPERANDI:
  
  BCF f,b  : Bit clear f
  BSF f,b  : Bit set f
  BTFSC f,b: Bit test f , Skip if clear
  BTFSS f,b: Bit testf f, Skip if set
 
. Literal and control operations (except GOTO)
k = 8bit immideate value.
  11------8-7----------0
  OPCODE----k-----------

  OPCODES AND OPERANDI:

  ANDLW  k : And literal W
  CALL   k : Call subroutine
  CLRWDT k : Clear Watchdog Timer
  IORLW  k : Inclusive OR literal with W
  MOVELW k : Move literal to W
  OPTION   : Load OPTION register
  RETLW  k : Return, place literal in W
  SLEEP    : Go into standby mode
  TRIS   f : Load TRIS register
  XORLW  k : Exclusive OR literal to W

. Literal and control operations - GOTO instruction: 
k = 9-bit immediate value
  11------9-8----------0
  OPCODE----k-----------

  OPCODES AND OPERANDI:

  GOTO k   : Unconditional branch
